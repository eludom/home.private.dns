This repo contains files and aliases for dealing with DNS on my home
network.  Here is the help from the resolv function that is defined:

  Usage: resolv [show|list|help|NAME]
  
  Examples:
    resolv quad9 # switch to quad9 resolv.conf
    resolv show  # show the current /etc/resolv.conf
    resolv list  # list avalable $HOME/etc/resolv.conf.NAME options
  
  
  FILES:
    This assumes that there are files in $HOME/etc/resolv.conf.NAME
    such as
  
      /etc/resolv.conf.quad9
      /etc/resolv.conf.google
      /etc/resolv.conf.homenet
  
    which will be copied to /etc/resolv.conf

This was written to work with Pi-Hole DNS on Linux.
