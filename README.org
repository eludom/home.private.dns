* What is this?
This repo contains files and aliases for dealing with DNS on my home
network.

* Example and usage
Here is the help from the resolv function that is defined:

  #+begin_example
  Usage: resolv [show|list|help|NAME]
  
  Examples:
    resolv quad9 # switch to quad9 resolv.conf
    resolv show  # show the current /etc/resolv.conf
    resolv list  # list avalable $HOME/etc/resolv.conf.NAME options
  
  
  FILES:
    This assumes that there are files in $HOME/etc/resolv.conf.NAME
    such as
  
      /etc/resolv.conf.quad9
      /etc/resolv.conf.google
      /etc/resolv.conf.homenet
  
    which will be copied to /etc/resolv.conf
  #+end_example

* Why is this?  
  This was written to work with Pi-Hole DNS on Linux.

* To Install
  The files in this repo are arranged to work as a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU stow]]
  package. Stow symlinks "packages" into $HOME (or wherever).

  To install this package, do something like:

  #+begin_example
  cd ~
  mkdir stow
  cd stow
  git clone https://github.com/eludom/home.private.dns.git
  stow -v home.private.dns
  #+end_example

* To Use
  
#+begin_example
  # put in .bashrc
  source ~/rc.local/dns-alises.sh  

  # get help
  resolv

  # show current resolv.conf
  resolv show

  # list resolv.conf options
  resolv list

  # select quad9 DNS
  resolv quad9

  # show the result
  resolv show

  # test.  Look at ";; SERVER: ..."
  dig ftp.uu.net 
#+end_example
